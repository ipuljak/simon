#Simon Game

An attempt to recreate the famous [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) of the 1980's written in Javascript with jQuery & HTML/CSS. Upon starting it, the game will begin to display a series of flashing lights and sounds which the user must replicate, with the series incrementing by one at each successful stage. Implemented to gain a better understanding of Javascript timers.

###How To###

To play the Simon game, clone the repo and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice.
